# Task: Use a meaningful data visualisation using this data.

```{r viz}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

```
The palmerpenguins data contains size measurements, clutch observations, and blood isotope ratios for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica over a study period of three years. You can read more about the dataset on https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/07/palmerpenguins-cran/ 


```{r penguins}
# import the dataset 
penguins = penguins

# view structure of the data
str(penguins)
glimpse(penguins)

# dimention of dataset
dim(penguins)

# Data Wrangling
# summary statistics 
library(skimr)
skim(penguins)

# check for missing values 
sum(is.na(penguins)) # 19 missing values 

# show number of missing values in each column
colSums(is.na(penguins))  # the sex variables have 11 mising values 

# lets remove null values 
penguins = na.omit(penguins)

# check to see if null values removed 
colSums(is.na(penguins))

# lets build a classification model to predict the gender of the penguins

```{r penguins modelling}
# drop column year- wont be used for our modelling 

penguins = penguins %>% select(-year)

# import tidymodel library (for machine learning)
library(tidymodels)

# split dataset into training and testing set
set.seed(100) # ensures reproducibility
penguins_split = initial_split(penguins, prop = 0.75, strata = sex)
penguins_train = training(penguins_split)
penguins_test = testing(penguins_split)
```
# Create 10 K fold resampling 
```{r }
set.seed(100)
kfolds = vfold_cv(penguins_train, v = 10)
kfolds

```

# Lets compare two models: A simple Logistic Regression and Random Forest model using Todymodel workflow
Step 1: Specify the models

```{r }
# logistic reg
glm_spec = logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  set_engine("glm")

# Random Forest Model
rand_spec = rand_forest() %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  set_engine("ranger")

```

# Step 2: Set workflow pipeline 

```{r }
penguins_wf = workflow() %>% 
  add_formula(sex~.) # we will model sex against all other variables 
```
# Step 3: Fit the Models against each of the resamples 

Fit Logistic model
```{r }
glm_fit = penguins_wf %>% 
  add_model(glm_spec) %>% 
  fit_resamples(
    resamples = kfolds,
    control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)
  )
glm_fit
```

Fit Random Forest model
```{r }
rand_fit = penguins_wf %>% 
  add_model(rand_spec) %>% 
  fit_resamples(
    resamples = kfolds,
    control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)
  )
rand_fit
```
# Evaluate the results 
```{r }
# Performance metrics of Logistic model 
glm_fit %>% collect_metrics() # 92% Training Accuracy

# Performance metrics of Random Forest model 
rand_fit %>% collect_metrics() # 92% Training Accuracy 
```

# Both models have similar accuracy. Folowing Ocam Razor Principle, we will pick the logistic model which is simpler and more explainable. We will fit on the training data and evaluate on the testing data using last_fit 

```{r }
penguins_final = penguins_wf %>% 
  add_model(glm_spec) %>% 
  last_fit(penguins_split)
penguins_final
```

```{r }

penguins_final %>% collect_metrics()
```
# The Logistic model has an accuracy of 91% on the test dataset. It is not overfitting 

```{r }
# get the confusion matrix 
penguins_final %>% 
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  conf_mat(sex, .pred_class)
```

# Lets get the odd ratios of the predictors to see which variables were significant in predicting the gender of the penguins 

```{r }
penguins_final$.workflow[[1]] %>% 
  tidy(exponentiate = TRUE)
```
The largest odds ratio is for islandTorgersen, with the second largest for bill depth. An increase of 1 mm in bill depth corresponds to 5x higher odds of being male. The characteristics of a penguinâ€™s bill must be associated with their sex. 

```{r }
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(bill_depth_mm, bill_length_mm, color = sex, size = body_mass_g))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~species)+
  labs(color = "Sex", size = "Body Mass (grams)")+
  theme_bw()

```


# Female and male penguins are much more seperated.
