import random # module used to create random numbers 

number= random.randint(1,10) # random numbers between 1 and 10
name= str(input("What's your name: ")) # ask user to enter therir name
print(f"\n{name.capitalize()}, guess a number between 1 and 10\n")
guess= int(input("What is your guess? ")) # ask user to guess a number 
if guess==number:
  print(f"\nMy number is {number}, you guessed {guess}. Congrats, you guessed correctly.")
else:
  print(f"\nMy number is {number}, you guessed {guess}. Sorry, your guess is wrong.")
